- 🕵️ **Data Workbench**: Explore your data with a 3D semantic visualizer

## Getting Started

For developers, **TrustGraph** has the following APIs and CLI:

- [**REST API**](docs/apis/README.md#rest-apis)
- [**Websocket API**](docs/apis/README.md#websocket-api)
- [**Python SDK**](https://trustgraph.ai/docs/api/apistarted)
- [**TrustGraph CLI**](https://trustgraph.ai/docs/running/cli)

See the [API Developer's Guide](#api-documentation) for more information.

For users, **TrustGraph** has the following interfaces:

- [**Configuration Portal**](#configuration-portal)
- [**Data Workbench**](#data-workbench)

The `TrustGraph CLI` installs the commands for interacting with TrustGraph while running along with the Python SDK. The `Configuration Portal` enables customization of TrustGraph deployments prior to launching. The **REST API** can be accessed through port `8088` of the TrustGraph host machine with JSON request and response bodies.

### Install the TrustGraph CLI

```
pip3 install trustgraph-cli==0.18.14
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `TrustGraph CLI` version must match the desired `TrustGraph` release version.

## Configuration Portal

TrustGraph is endlessly customizable by editing the `YAML` launch files. The `Configuration Portal` provides a quick and intuitive tool for building a custom configuration that deploys with Docker, Podman, Minikube, or Google Cloud. There is a `Configuration Portal` for the both the lastest and stable `TrustGraph` releases.

- [**Configuration Portal** (Stable 0.18.14) 🚀](https://config-ui.demo.trustgraph.ai/)
- [**Configuration Portal** (Latest 0.19.3) 🚀](https://dev.config-ui.demo.trustgraph.ai/)

The `Configuration Portal` has 4 important sections:

- **Component Selection** ✅: Choose from the available deployment platforms, LLMs, graph store, VectorDB, chunking algorithm, chunking parameters, and LLM parameters
- **Customization** 🧰: Customize the prompts for the LLM System, Data Extraction Agents, and Agent Flow
- **Data Workbench** 🕵️: Add the **Data Workbench** to the configuration available on port `8888`
- **Finish Deployment** 🚀: Download the launch `YAML` files with deployment instructions

The `Configuration Portal` will generate the `YAML` files in `deploy.zip`. Once `deploy.zip` has been downloaded and unzipped, launching TrustGraph is as simple as navigating to the `deploy` directory and running:

```
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> Docker is the recommended container orchestration platform for first getting started with TrustGraph.

When finished, shutting down TrustGraph is as simple as:
```
docker compose down -v
```

## Data Workbench

If added to the build in the `Configuration Portal`, the `Data Workbench` will be available at port `8888`. The `Data Workbench` has 4 capabilities:

- **System Chat** 💬: GraphRAG queries in a chat interface
- **Data Explorer** 🕵️: See semantic relationships in a list structure
- **Data Visualizer** 🌐: Visualize semantic relationships in **3D**
- **Data Loader** 📂: Directly load `.pdf`, `.txt`, or `.md` into the system 

## Example TrustGraph Notebooks

- [**REST API Notebooks**](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/example-notebooks/tree/master/api-examples)
- [**Python SDK Notebooks**](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/example-notebooks/tree/master/api-library)

## Prebuilt Configuration Files

TrustGraph `YAML` files are available [here](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/trustgraph/releases). Download `deploy.zip` for the desired release version.

| Release Type | Release Version |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Latest | [0.19.3](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/trustgraph/releases/download/v0.19.3/deploy.zip) |
| Stable | [0.18.14](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/trustgraph/releases/download/v0.18.14/deploy.zip) |

TrustGraph is fully containerized and is launched with a `YAML` configuration file. Unzipping the `deploy.zip` will add the `deploy` directory with the following subdirectories:

- `docker-compose`
- `minikube-k8s`
- `gcp-k8s`

> [!NOTE]
> As more integrations have been added, the number of possible combinations of configurations has become quite large. It is recommended to use the `Configuration Portal` to build your deployment configuration. Each directory contains `YAML` configuration files for the default component selections.

**Docker**:
```
docker compose -f <launch-file.yaml> up -d
```

**Kubernetes**:
```
kubectl apply -f <launch-file.yaml>
```

## Architecture

![architecture](tg-arch-diagram.svg)

TrustGraph is designed to be modular to support as many LLMs and environments as possible. A natural fit for a modular architecture is to decompose functions into a set of modules connected through a pub/sub backbone. [Apache Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/) serves as this pub/sub backbone. Pulsar acts as the data broker managing data processing queues connected to procesing modules.

### Pulsar Workflows

- For processing flows, Pulsar accepts the output of a processing module and queues it for input to the next subscribed module.
- For services such as LLMs and embeddings, Pulsar provides a client/server model.  A Pulsar queue is used as the input to the service.  When processed, the output is then delivered to a separate queue where a client subscriber can request that output.

## Data Extraction Agents

TrustGraph extracts knowledge documents to an ultra-dense knowledge graph using 3 automonous data extraction agents. These agents focus on individual elements needed to build the knowledge graph. The agents are:

- Topic Extraction Agent
- Entity Extraction Agent
- Relationship Extraction Agent

The agent prompts are built through templates, enabling customized data extraction agents for a specific use case. The data extraction agents are launched automatically with the loader commands.

PDF file:
```
tg-load-pdf <document.pdf>
```

Text or Markdown file:
```
tg-load-text <document.txt>
```

## GraphRAG Queries

Once the knowledge graph and embeddings have been built or a knowledge core has been loaded, RAG queries are launched with a single line:

```
tg-query-graph-rag -q "Write a blog post about the 5 key takeaways from SB1047 and how they will impact AI development."
```

## Agent Flow

Invoking the Agent Flow will use a ReAct style approach the combines GraphRAG and text completion requests to think through a problem solution.

```
tg-invoke-agent -v -q "Write a blog post about the 5 key takeaways from SB1047 and how they will impact AI development."
```

> [!TIP]
> Adding `-v` to the agent request will return all of the agent manager's thoughts and observations that led to the final response.
